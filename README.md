# Honeybee Voting Web front-end

## Frameworks and Tools:
- Bootstrap
- Angular 1.3
- ES6
- Babel
- Webpack
- ESLint
- Gulp

## What works/half-works at the moment

- Expects service to be on localhost:8000 (no idea what will happen if server is on a different docker container)
- Website ends up on localhost:3000
  - plain-old localhost:3000 is exciting, but I didn't have anything to do with that.
  - localhost:3000/candidates
  - localhost:3000/voters
  - localhost:3000/elections
  - localhost:3000/voter-detail
  - localhost:3000/candidate-detail
